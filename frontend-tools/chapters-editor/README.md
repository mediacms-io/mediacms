## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20+) - Use `nvm use 20` if you have nvm installed
- Yarn or npm package manager

### Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the Chapters Editor directory
cd frontend-tools/chapters-editor

# Install dependencies with Yarn
yarn install

# Or with npm
npm install
```

## Development

The Chapters Editor can be run in two modes:

### Standalone Development Mode

This starts a local development server with hot reloading:

```bash
# Start the development server with Yarn
yarn dev

# Or with npm
npm run dev
```

### Frontend-only Development Mode

If you want to work only on the frontend with MediaCMS backend:

```bash
# Start frontend-only development with Yarn
yarn dev:frontend

# Or with npm
npm run dev:frontend
```

## Building

### For MediaCMS Integration

To build the Chapters Editor for integration with MediaCMS:

```bash
# Build for Django integration with Yarn
yarn build:django

# Or with npm
npm run build:django
```

This will compile the editor and place the output in the MediaCMS static directory.

### Standalone Build

To build the editor as a standalone application:

```bash
# Build for production with Yarn
yarn build

# Or with npm
npm run build
```

## Deployment

To deploy the Chapters Editor, you can use the build and deploy script (recommended):

```bash
# Run the deployment script
sh deploy/scripts/build_and_deploy.sh
```

The build script handles all necessary steps for compiling and deploying the editor to MediaCMS.

You can also deploy manually after building:

```bash
# With Yarn
yarn deploy

# Or with npm
npm run deploy
```

## Project Structure

- `/client` - Frontend React application
    - `/src` - Source code
        - `/components` - React components for chapter editing
        - `/hooks` - Custom React hooks for chapter management
        - `/lib` - Utility functions and helpers
        - `/services` - API services for MediaCMS integration
        - `/styles` - CSS and style definitions
- `/shared` - Shared TypeScript types and utilities

## API Integration

The Chapters Editor interfaces with MediaCMS through a set of API endpoints for:

- Retrieving video metadata and existing chapters
- Saving chapter data (timestamps, titles, descriptions)
- Validating chapter structure and timing
- Integration with MediaCMS user permissions

### Chapter Data Format

Chapters are stored in the following format:

```json
{
    "chapters": [
        {
            "id": "chapter-1",
            "title": "Introduction",
            "startTime": 0,
            "endTime": 120,
            "description": "Opening remarks and overview"
        },
        {
            "id": "chapter-2",
            "title": "Main Content",
            "startTime": 120,
            "endTime": 600,
            "description": "Core educational material"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Code Formatting

To automatically format all source files using [Prettier](https://prettier.io):

```bash
# Format all code in the src directory
npx prettier --write client/src/

# Or format specific file types
npx prettier --write "client/src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,css,scss,md}"
```

You can also add this as a script in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "format": "prettier --write client/src/"
}
```

Then run:

```bash
yarn format
# or
npm run format
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to ensure Chapters Editor functionality:

```bash
# Run tests with Yarn
yarn test

# Or with npm
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
yarn test:watch
npm run test:watch
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Chapter timestamps not saving**: Ensure the MediaCMS backend API is accessible and user has proper permissions.

**Timeline not displaying correctly**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors and ensure video file is properly loaded.

**Performance issues with long videos**: The editor is optimized for videos up to 2 hours. For longer content, consider splitting into multiple files.

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:

```bash
# Start with debug logging
DEBUG=true yarn dev
```
