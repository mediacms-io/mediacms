MediaCMS is a modern, fully featured open source video and media CMS. It is developed to meet the needs of modern web platforms for viewing and sharing media. It can be used to build a small to medium video and media portal within minutes.

It is built mostly using the modern stack Django + React and includes a REST API.

A demo is available at https://demo.mediacms.io

## Example cases

- **Schools, education.** Administrators and editors keep what content will be published, students are not distracted with advertisements and irrelevant content, plus they have the ability to select either to stream or download content.
- **Organization sensitive content.** In cases where content is sensitive and cannot be uploaded to external sites.
- **Build a great community.** MediaCMS can be customized (URLs, logos, fonts, aesthetics) so that you create a highly customized video portal for your community!
- **Personal portal.** Organize, categorize and host your content the way you prefer.


## Philosophy

We believe there's a need for quality open source web applications that can be used to build community portals and support collaboration.
We have three goals for MediaCMS: a) deliver all functionality one would expect from a modern system, b) allow for easy installation and maintenance, c) allow easy customization and addition of features.

## Hardware considerations

For a small to medium installation, with a few hours of video uploaded daily, and a few hundreds of active daily users viewing content, 4GB Ram / 2-4 CPUs as minimum is ok. For a larger installation with many hours of video uploaded daily, consider adding more CPUs and more Ram.

In terms of disk space, think of what the needs will be. A general rule is to multiply by three the size of the expected uploaded videos (since the system keeps original versions, encoded versions plus HLS), so if you receive 1G of videos daily and maintain all of them, you should consider a 1T disk across a year (1G * 3 * 365).


## Installation / Maintanance

There are two ways to run MediaCMS, through Docker Compose and through installing it on a server via an automation script that installs and configures all needed services. Find the related pages:
